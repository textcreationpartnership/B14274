            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Apostle in all his Epistles to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Gentiles, begins with <hi>Grace and Peace,</hi> so in his Epistle to the Saints in <hi>Rome, Grace be with you and Peace.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> being the Apostle of the Gentiles, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes Christs rule in preaching the glad tidings of the Gospell of Peace, and because hee foresaw there would bee many resisters of this Doctrine, hee is therefore more diligent in giving war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to all the Churches to beware of false teachers, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>ver.</hi> 29, 30. hee tells them, <hi>That after his departure
<pb facs="tcp:177024:3"/>from them, there should arise men speaking perverse things, to draw disciples after them, yea greedy wolves.</hi> At this time the divisions and contentions betwixt the beleeving Gentiles, and unbeleeving Jewes at <hi>Rome</hi> were so great, that <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour commanded all the Jewes to depart from <hi>Rome, Acts</hi> 18. this moved the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to write this Epistle to the <hi>Romanes</hi> after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> to <hi>Corinth.</hi> O how carefull was he to give them charge to marke those that caused tents, divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and schismes in the Church, and to avoid them. In like manner, the Author of this short Treatise seeing so many Schismes, and divisions in the Church, and publique State, that both of them as it were lay a bleeding, with the like care, and compassion, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the miserable condition of both, and to that end that these so dangerous evills may bee remooved, hee gives Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veats to avoid all Conventicles of Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratists, Anabaptists, Familists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as also
<pb facs="tcp:177024:3"/>the seducing of Priests and Iesuites, which swarme too much among us, who crie up themselves to bee the onely Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, and members of the true Church, who brag and boast so much of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to bee their Founder, yet denie to give to <hi>Caesar,</hi> (who is Christs Lieftenant) his supremacy over the Churches of his owne Kingdomes; briefely the Authors drift and scope in this ensuing Discourse, is to discover all such as cause any divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or disturbance in Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, and so consequently are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Peace of both, that so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discovered, they may more easily be avoided. Therefore whosoever desireth to follow <hi>the God of Peace,</hi> let mee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire him to reade this short yet sweet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, to perswade all Christians to Unity and Peace, which doubtlesse wee will more eagerly pursue, and more hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily embrace, when from hence wee shall learne what confusions have fallen upon Churches and Common wealths by Schismes, and divisions wrought by Satan
<pb facs="tcp:177024:4"/>and his instruments in all ages. Now <hi>the God of Peace</hi> engrave this desire of Peace in all our hearts, and that <hi>Prince of Peace, who hath washed us from our sinnes, and made our Peace with his Father, guide us by the Spirit of Peace to that heavenly Ierusalem, the land of Peace.</hi> To the Sacred Trinity, the Authors of our Peace be given all Glory for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Aint <hi>Paul,</hi> Verse 15. of this Chapter giveth the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> an item to observe and avoid Schismaticks, such as cause divisions and offences contrary to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospell; marke them and avoid them: so the Apostle: marke them as you would the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silisk,</hi> avoid them as you would the Pesthouse, where <hi>Lord have mercy upon us</hi> is written on the doore. To which purpose hee useth three
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:177024:5"/>effectuall motives in the three subsequent verses.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, taken from the evill condition of <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,</hi> verse 18. <hi>they are such as serve their owne bellies,</hi> such as deceive the hearts of the simple.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, from the discretion which ought to be in the <hi>Romanes</hi> and in all Christians, That they should <hi>joyne wisedome with their simplicity:</hi> we must be simple in devising evill, yet wise in discerning true doctrine from false, <hi>vers.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, from the hope of <hi>victory</hi> which. God shall give us. <hi>The God of Peace shall,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>[Satan]</hi> him, and all his instruments, all decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, all Schismaticks, all that are opposite to the truth, all that are opposite unto <hi>Peace, He</hi> will ere long <hi>tread under our feete,</hi> that is, the God of Peace. This is the Apostles argument to stirre them up to watchfullnesse against false teachers, drawne from the hope of victory; they shall ere long be subdued and conquered.</p>
            <p>The particulars to be observed are these. 1. The Conqueror. 2. The Conquered. 3. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. 4. The manner of the Conquest. 5. The time of the Conquest.</p>
            <p>First, the Conquerour, <hi>the God of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the Conquered, <hi>Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Conquest, <hi>shall bruise,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>

            <p>Fourthly, the manner, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>: <hi>under your feete.</hi>

                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>The God of Peace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>First, the Conquerour, <hi>the God of Peace,</hi> because
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:177024:5"/>he had before mentioned those that cause divisions and offences, now (saith Saint <hi>Chrysostome in locum</hi>) he mentioneth <hi>the God of Peace,</hi> that so they might be confident of their freedome from them; for he that loveth peace shall destroy those things that are contrary unto it. And he doth not say shall subdue, but (which is more) <hi>shall bruise</hi> or <hi>crush,</hi> and he doth not only say these deceavers, but even he that is their Captaine, <hi>Satan,</hi> and not only he shall bruise him, but bruise him <hi>under your feete,</hi> that so they might carry away the victory; and having gotten the trophee, might become glorious. Yea further heere's a comfort too from the very time; it shall not be long ere this shall be accomplished: for <hi>the God of Peace,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shortly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the particulars in which we shall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise your patience and devotion at this time.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>the God of Peace</hi>] Which words I may handle two waies: first, apart by themselves; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, joyntly with the rest. By themselves, and so shew you that <hi>God is a God of Peace;</hi> with the rest, and so shew you that it is this God of peace (not men of peace, but the God of peace) that doth settle his Church in peace, and tread downe such as oppose it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God is the God of Peace.</hi> This is one speciall Attribute by which he hath pleased to manifest himselfe unto us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.33. <hi>The God of Peace be with you all:</hi> so in sundry places of Scripture hee is stiled. <hi>Peace</hi> is founded in the sacred Trinity; it is a name applyed to the Father, Sonne, and Spirit, a worke performed by them. 1. <hi>God</hi> the Father
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:177024:6"/>
               <hi>was in Christ reconciling the world to himselfe,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. that is, making peace: <hi>Hee speakes peace unto his people and to his Saints, Psal.</hi> 85.8. <hi>He maketh Warres to cease to the end of the earth, he breaketh the bow,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 46.9.</note>
               <hi>he cutteth the speare in sunder, he burneth the Chariot in the fire, and planteth peace in the borders of his people. Levit.</hi> 26.6. The name of his house is <hi>Peace:</hi> for his dwelling is at <hi>Salem,</hi> that is <hi>Peace, Psal.</hi> 76.2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God the Sonne,</hi> is <hi>a God of Peace;</hi> he is intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Prince of Peace, Isa.</hi> 9.6. and <hi>Peace it selfe, Ephes.</hi> 2.14. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, for hee is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath beaten downe the middle wall of partition betweene us so making peace; He brake downe a double par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition wall, reconciling <hi>Iew</hi> un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o <hi>Gentile,</hi> and both unto God: Therefore is he a <hi>God of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. So also is the third person, the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> for peace is <hi>a fruit of the Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The Kingdome of God is not in meate and drink, but righteousnesse and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, Rom.</hi> 14.17. Why doth he name the <hi>Holy Ghost?</hi> to shew the Author and the fountaine of these gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: that <hi>Righteousnesse, Ioy,</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> doe proceed from him.</p>
            <p>There is a threefold warre in the soule of man: Passion fighting against reason, the flesh fighting against the Spirit, the terrour of conscience wrestling with the wrath of God. Now the Holy Ghost doth calme the heate of these combates, and therefore is he a <hi>God of Peace.</hi>

            <p>The two conclusions which I have opened, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse. </seg>
               </label> are now to be applied: They are Usefull many waies.</p>
            <p>First, is God a <hi>God of Peace?</hi> 1. If he be a God of Peace, then those things are not from God which are contrary to peace, and therefore to be avoided. 2. If he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then peace must needs be a divine thing, and therefore to be imbraced. 3. If he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then from whom, but from him who is the Author of Peace, should we seek Peace?</p>
            <p>First, if he be a God of peace, then those things are not from him which are contrary to peace; for contraries have contrary causes: but what are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:177024:8"/>they? <hi>Aquin.</hi> 22.37. 1. reckons up these. 1. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord which is in the heart. 2. Contention which is in words. 3. Schisme, strife, unlawfull Warres and Sedition which are works contrary to peace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Discord. This is not a peaceable affection but an uncharitable passion, unquiet, inordinate, proceeding from pride, envie, selfe-love, vaine-glory, and such like distempers of an unpeaceable soule: It is a disjoyning or disjoynting of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a disuniting of hearts, a dissolving of the bond of Concord. They that give themselves to this kinde of <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> studie nothing but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision; they love no musique but jarring, they are Separatists in affection, and wholy addicted to breake the peace: The Divell feares nothing so much as the keeping of amity and concord. This Discord and mentall disagreement doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from him who is the God of Peace; <hi>It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensuall, and divelish, Iam.</hi> 3.15. Thinke upon this, yee that alienate your affections from your brethren, that are full of heart burnings against your neighbours, and cannot endure that they should prosper or have successe in any good; this comes not from the Spirit of God, he is a God of Peace, such a one as loveth Concord and makes agreement. <hi>Hee that soweth discord amongst brethren,</hi> is the Divels seeds-man, <hi>an abhomination unto the Lord, Pro.</hi> 6.16, 19.</p>
            <p>But me thinks I see <hi>Iehu</hi> marching furiously and saying, <hi>What hast thou to doe with peace?</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
               </label> Doth not Christ say, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.34. <hi>Thinke not that I am
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:177024:9"/>come to send peace on earth, I came not to send peace, but a sword?</hi> It seemes therefore that Christ is not the Author of peace but of division and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. I answer with Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> it is not the purpose of Christ to make division; for hee would that all men should with an unanimous consent agree to follow the truth, he is called <hi>the Prince of Peace,</hi> he commands his Disciples <hi>to preach Peace,</hi> when they come to an house to say, <hi>Peace be to this house.</hi> And the Prophets foretold that in his raigne there should be <hi>much peace.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to cleare this place, we must distinguish of peace.</p>
            <p>There is a seeming peace,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aquin.</hi> 22.29. 2, 3.</note> and a true peace, a seeming peace is that which is amongst wicked men, rather a conspiracy then a peace, a faction not an union: for they want the soalder which should glew them together, and that is faith. Christ came not to send a seeming peace, peace in sinne, an agreement of wicked men in evill, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.22. nor will he have good men to be at peace with them, to have peace to share in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <hi>to have fellowship with them in the unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full workes of darknesse:</hi> he came to send a sword, to raise a combat betweene Grace and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Christ maketh not discord betweene man and man, as they are creatures; but betwixt good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and evill as they are contraries of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; Christ and the Gospell are not properly the cause, but the occasion: for when the Gospell disjoynes us from the world, the world out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice doth bend his forces against us, <hi>Aquin</hi> 22.37. 1, 2.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:177024:9"/>saith well, <hi>The will of man cleaving unto God is a right rule (regula regulata)</hi> from which it is a sinne to discord or dissent; but the will of man being contrary unto God is a crooked rule from which it is good to dissent: In this kinde to cause discord by which that concord is dissolved that is naught, is a laudable thing. And in this sense <hi>Christ</hi> saith, <hi>I came not to send peace, but a sword.</hi> And he speaketh thus (saith Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi>) to arme his Disciples against troubles, and to prevent all objections in his followers being in trouble for his sake; for he sought not to allure them with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing words, but at the first told them the hardest things; seeing there is nothing more sharp then a sword, no warre so grievous as betwixt Sonne and Father, Daughter and Mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Christ saith, <hi>He came to send,</hi> that is, to occasion; for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly this ariseth out of mens corruption.</p>
            <p>But some that are Advocates for discord will perhaps pleade the example of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> 15.39. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> A contention was so sharpe betwixt them, <hi>that they departed the one from the other. Resp.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> did onely <hi>dissentire,</hi> not <hi>discordare,</hi> they were divers in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion one from another, but not adverse in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one to another. The disagreement which was betweene them did not untie the in dissoluble knot of concord, for (as <hi>Aquin.</hi> 22 29.3.2.) <hi>Concordia est unio voluntatum non unio opinionum,</hi> Concord is the union of wills and affections not the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of opinions. The same Schooleman, <hi>Ibid.</hi> 37. <hi>quest. art.</hi> 1, 3. doth directly answer this objection
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:177024:10"/>in this manner. The discord betweene Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> was onely accidentall; both of them did intend good: but that did seeme good to the one which did not seeme so to the other, which proceeded from humane infirmity: for in those things which are necessary to salvation, there was no such controversie betweene them: and this fell out by the providence of God, who made it profitable to the Church; so that the seeming discord which was betweene these two, cannot justifie that discord which is betweene such who intend not the good one of another, but rather the contrary. A common fault amongst us; for we daily see person devided against person, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily against family, Corporation against Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Ephraim</hi> against <hi>Manasses, Manasses</hi> against <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and both against <hi>Iuda.</hi> How unlike are these to those Primitive Christians, that were all of one heart and of one soule. No marvaile if it goes ill with the Church, when there is such discord betweene the members of it. If forces united be the stronger, then being devided, they must needs be the weaker; if that which is little increaseth by concord, then that which is great must needs decrease by discord,<note place="margin">Prudent Psy.

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariewise it is worthy of extraordinary note, how that upstart family of the Kings of <hi>Pergamus</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it selfe to marvellous greatnesse in very short space, from the condition of meere slavery; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a principall cause was the brotherly love main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by them. Brethren do now agree as <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Perseus</hi> (the sons of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi>) they seek the estates not the lives of each other. We are all children of one Father, servants of one Family, stones of one building, therefore must not jarre one with another, least we ruine the whole house. Where there is discord there can be no safety, no peace: for discord which is fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by turbulent and violent spirits, is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to peace, then not from him who is <hi>the God of Peace.</hi> Therefore to be avoided.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another thing which is contrary to peace is alteration or contention in words: for, <hi>Contende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> is <hi>Contra alium tendere,</hi> to goe against another, discord is the contriver of many mischiefes, not that all verball contention is opposite to peace,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:177024:11"/>but that which is irregular in the end, or inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the manner: for these two must still be considered, <hi>Motus animi, &amp; modus rei,</hi> the intent of the minde, the manner of the thing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which is irregular in the end, as when it is a mans intention to contend against the truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which is inordinate in the manner; as when a man doth contend for the truth; but with too much sharpnesse and bitternesse; whether he doth contend for the truth or against falsehood; he must doe it with lenity and meekenesse, in a right order and manner. It is true, that zeale is earnest; but true zeale (such as is joyn'd with knowledge) is joyned with charity, and therefore is alwaies circumscribed within the bounds of modesty and peace. It doth declare it selfe not in virulent and maligning speeches, in slanders, scoldings, reproaches, calumnies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giving a caveat against this verball contention, or strife in words, tells us that it is unprofitable and tends to the subverting of those that heare it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14. he sharpely rebukes the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> for it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11, 12. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.3. and tells them that hereby they manifest themselves <hi>to be carnall: whereas there is among you envying, strife and divisions, are you not carnall, &amp;c?</hi> This is not a fruit of the Spirit, it proceeds not from the God of Peace; it is an effect of folly. <hi>Pro.</hi> 18.6. <hi>A fooles lips enter into contention.</hi>

               </label> Wee must observe the Cautions which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> addeth. First, if it be possible with faith, and a good conscience. If it may stand with your Religion and profession, <hi>have peace with all men;</hi> keepe peace with as many as possibly you can, so you may keepe peace with your selves,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:177024:14"/>peace with your God, peace with your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences: but when you see either the truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied, or God offended by mens evill; you must not under pretence of keeping peace be silent in such cases.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>as much as in you lieth;</hi> for some are so contentious that they will live peaceably with none, <hi>Psal.</hi> 120.6, 7. But yet we must doe our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that there be no fault in us. Doe thou that which is thy duty: if some will not have peace with thee, yet be thou friendly and peaceable in thine owne disposition. For the former of these two causes, Protestants cannot make a pacification with Papists. It is not possible to doe this except we let goe our faith, and make shipwrack of a good conscience: I grant wee have peace with them in respect of civill society, but not in respect of sacred societie; wee must have no fellowship with them in Religion. Where a pacification is made, both the parties must yeeld somewhat; but we may not part with any point of our Religion to the Papist. In an instrument of Musick the strings out of tune are set up or set downe to the rest; the strings that are in tune are not stirred: so the Papists being out of tune are to be conformed to us not we to them. Our Refusall of this pacification argues no hatred of true peace: <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:177024:15"/>the matter lawfull: for such is their refractory frowardnesse, that they study nothing more then to oppose us; and even hate the name of peace. No hope of reconciliation with them. But where peace may be had without the overthrow of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the Exchange of faith, the pursuit of it is by no meanes to be neglected; whether it be Ecclesiasticall peace, or Politicall peace, or Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicall or Domesticall peace.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>3</label> but from him should we seeke peace? Peace is a thing very desirable. <hi>Pacem te poscimus omnes:</hi> Peace is desired of all men, as that great Potentate (<hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi>) wrote in his letter. Would'st thou then have thy desire in the fruition of true peace? Have recourse unto the Fountaine from whence it is derived, and that's God. Thus did S. <hi>Paul.</hi> 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Now the God of peace himselfe give you peace alwaies, by all meanes;</hi> for what we see Saint <hi>Paul</hi> practise, we have <hi>Ieremies</hi> precept, <hi>Ier.</hi> 29.7. He directs the people thus; <hi>Seek the peace of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and pray unto the Lord for it:</hi> Why unto the Lord? Because he is the <hi>God of Peace:</hi> whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver peace we wish for, we must seek it at his hands; and that with so much the more vehemency; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause peace is of such excellency and necessity both in Church and Common-wealth. Doe we desire the peace of either of these, or of both these? Yee learne of whom to seek it; <hi>Pray for the peace of Hierusalem,</hi> pray unto him that is the God of peace; and indeed, it is now high time to pray. Shall I tell you what a want of peace there is abroad in our neighbour Churches? Alas! Ye daily heare how peace hath long since vanished from amongst them, nothing doth there appeare to the poore Saints of Christ, but the dreadfull face of warre: they have heard and daily heare the clattering of Armour, the ratling of Trumpets,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:177024:16"/>the thundring of Cannons, the cryes of the wounded, the groanes of the dying; they have seene the demolishing of Temples, the destow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Virgins, the rapes of Matrons, the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Infants, the vastation of fields, and spoyling of houses. They have felt the edge of the devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring sword, which hath beene made drunke with their blood; and have had their flesh given for meate to the fowles of the ayre: It is high time for us, even in their behalfe, to pray to <hi>the God of Peace.</hi> Perhaps yee will say we doe it for them; it is well if we doe; and shall wee not therefore doe it for our selves? In sober tearmes I pray you how stands the case with us at home? Is not the bond of peace ready to be broken amongst us? Nay, is it not already broken? Where are our eyes that we cannot see the Church lie a bleeding, the Common-wealth a bleeding, both wounded with the sword of unhappy divisions? Dangerously wounded, that they lie (as it were) gasping and ready to give up the Ghost? Desperately woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that none but he that is the Almighty <hi>(the God of Peace)</hi> is able to worke the cure? And now (if ever) wee stand in need of a <hi>Moses</hi> to goe unto our heavenly Surgeon, to implore his help, for salving the fores, and binding up the wounds of our disturbed State and distracted peace: of a <hi>Moses</hi> a meeke man, the meekest man upon the face of the earth; so hee shewed himselfe when <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> spake against him.<note place="margin">Numb. 12.3.</note> A peaceable man one that did peaceably suffer wrong himselfe, and made peace amongst
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:177024:16"/>Yee know how he endeavoured to make up the quarrell betweene the two Hebrewes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.13. A zealons man that earnestly praied for the peace of the Church, for the ruinating of her enemies. He lifted up his hands that the <hi>Amalekites</hi> might be discomfited; he stood in the gap, and by his humble supplications made peace betweene God and the people, staied the Cannons of Gods wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full indignation from playing upon the <hi>Israelites, Psal.</hi> 106.23. Now for a <hi>Moses,</hi> a man to stand up in the gap by his zealous supplications to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure peace. <hi>Prayer</hi> is the best Peace-maker we can now use. If now we make not use of prayer, wee can looke for nothing but the continuance of those evills which we already see, (Discord, Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Schisme) and for the succeeding of worse. Therefore unlesse we desire this mother of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (Peace) to be cast out of our Church, and for ever banished our Common-wealth, let us dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch this Messenger unto him that is <hi>the God of Peace,</hi> I meane zealous prayer.</p>
            <p>And as for publique, so for private peace; wee must seeke to him that is <hi>the God of Peace,</hi> desiring him to be reconciled to us, and at peace with us in his Sonne Christ. <hi>Psal</hi> 51. <hi>David</hi> praies unto him for this peace, both for the planting of externall peace in the borders of the Church; as also for the planting of internall peace in the confines of his owne conscience.</p>
            <p>There is no discord so dreadfull, as that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and the soule; better it is to be at odds with all the world, then to be at odds with him. By
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:177024:17"/>nature we are all at odds with him, as <hi>Adam</hi> was, who by <hi>tasting of the forbidden fruit,</hi> lost both his God and his peace, both for himselfe and his posterity.</p>
            <p>Now if wee would have the breach of this peace repaired, we must goe unto him who hath made peace for us, <hi>Ephaes.</hi> 2.16. and upon whom was laid the chastisement of our peace, that is, Christ Jesus, <hi>We have peace with God through our Lord Iesus Christ, Rom.</hi> 5.1.</p>
            <p>Finally, if we would have eternall peace, the peace of Heaven, the peace of Glory, that peace which consisteth in the fruition of the soveraigne good, and in the enjoyment of him who is <hi>the God of Peace;</hi> we must take the course before prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. In a word, whatsoever peace thou desirest to have, whether eternall, externall or internall, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peace in heaven, or peace on earth, whether peace in the Church or in the Common-wealth, or in thy family, or in thine owne conscience; seeke unto him who is <hi>the God of Peace,</hi> sue unto him who is <hi>the Prince of Peace,</hi> pray unto him who is <hi>the Spirit of Peace.</hi> This is the way to obtaine it.</p>
            <p>The second Part, the Conquest, <hi>shall bruise;</hi> he doth not say, <hi>the God of Peace</hi> shall subdue, but (which is more) <hi>shall bruise,</hi> crush, ortread downe. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, a word very Emphaticall: for it is used in those things which are so broken in peeces, that they cannot be repaired. The Greeks use it in the translation of the second Psalme 9. verse. <hi>Thou shalt breake them with an iron red, thou shalt dash them in peeces like a Potters vessell.</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:177024:17"/>The word in the Text. And a Potters vessell once broken cannot be made whole: thus shall <hi>the God of Peace</hi> breake Satan and bruise him in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; he shall so destroy him, that he shall never be able to recover himselfe; he shall so keepe him under as that he shall not prevaile against the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Church, nor hinder their salvation. And here there is an allusion to that ancient promise made to <hi>Eve, Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>That the seed of the woman should bruise the Serpents head.</hi> This hath Christ done for his members; and his members like wise doe it by vertue of Christ their Head: but when this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect victory shall be accomplished, that I shall shew anon, when I come to the time of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in the meane while let us consider the object of this Conquest, or the person conquered, <hi>Satan. The God of Peace,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>bruise Satan. Satan</hi> is an Hebrew word comming from a roote that sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to hate, to be contrary, whence such as are adversaries (contrary unto others) have this name imposed upon them, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 5.4. there is neither adversary nor evill occurrent. The originall word for adversary is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Satan.</hi> This is a name given both to man and divell. To man, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 5.4. when <hi>Peter</hi> sought to hinder Christ in the course of his calling he brands him with this name, <hi>Get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind mee Satan.</hi> To the Divell. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Satan</hi> came against the sonnes of God. So <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.1. When the <hi>High Priest stood before the Angell of the Lord, Satan stood at his right hand to resist him.</hi> There's both the name given him, and a reason
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:177024:18"/>given for the name; and the reason why he should have that name; because he carries himselfe like an adversary, is given to make resistance and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe peace. The like name he hath in the Greek, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. he is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, an adversary, <hi>Your adversary the Divell walketh, &amp;c.</hi> a name expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his nature: for he is the greatest adversary in the world: an adversary to God, to man, to all good things. Now this great adversary shall be bruised by him that is the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda.</hi> This old Serpent full of venemous malice, by Christ the new Serpent prefigured in the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent. But what? onely he? Shall no other adversaries of the Church be subdued? yes; all the rest, all the limbs of Satan, false Prophets, Schismaticks, Persecutors, and the rest that disturbe the peace of the Church: But why doth he onely name Satan? for these reasons as I conceive.</p>
            <p>First, because of the generall application of that name; it may be applied to all the adversaries of the Church, both men and divels.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because of that speciall association or affinity which is betweene the Divell and such as cause offences in the Church. The Apostle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had mentioned them, and comforting the Church against them, tells them that God shall tread Satan under their feet. Satan; intimating unto them how like they are unto him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, because <hi>Satan</hi> is the greatest enemie to the Church, the greatest enemy to <hi>peace.</hi> Where God plants peace, he labours to pluck it up, and like a wicked seeds-man, to sow the Tares of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:177024:18"/>Contention. He first dissolved the happy peace betweene God and man at the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> next the brotherly peace betweene man and man at the slaughter of <hi>Abel;</hi> then the peace betweene man and the creatures. Fourthly, betweene the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themselves. Fiftly, the peace which man at first had with himselfe, causing his unruly passions to contend in his corrupted soule, like the opposite Elements in the confused <hi>Chaos.</hi> And as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, so he ever since continueth to be an enemy unto true peace, and a ring-leader of all those that oppose the peace of the Church. Therefore the Apostle doth especially name him above all others; and to our comfort tells us, that <hi>the God of Peace shall bruise him,</hi> or tread him downe: for if the Shepheard be smitten, the sheepe must needs be scattered; if the Captaine be slaine, his troopes must needs be discomfited; if Satan be bruised, his followers must needs be conquered; and that victoriously, triumphantly beaten and trodden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot, which is the fourth particular.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the manner of the Conquest, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>under your feete;</hi> under our feete, that wee may carry away the victory, and get the trophie of triumph (as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi>) under our feet; as if we our selves did subdue him, and keep him under us,<note place="margin">Psal. 8. Heb. 2.8.</note>
               <hi>Thou hast put all things in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection under his feete,</hi> So the Psalmist, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Christ. And it is as true of Christians; that God hath put, though not all things, yet many things, in especiall Satan under their feet: so highly doth he vouchsafe to honour them; he that is our
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:177024:19"/>head having spoiled <hi>Principalities and Powers,</hi> and triumphed over Satan, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. doth give power to his members to doe the same. Ye know what power he gave to his Disciples, to tread on Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and Scorpions, and overall the power of the enemy, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.19. The like power is given unto us, though not in the literall, yet in the mysticall sence; to tread upon the old Serpent, to stampe under feete his most powerfull perswasions and temptations.<note place="margin">Heming. in loc</note> Then is Satan trod under our feete, saith a good Expositor, when by alively faith we are ingrafted into Christ, the Conqueror of Satan, and when, by a godly life we oppose the kingdome of Satan; <hi>Whatsoever is borne of God overcommeth the world, and this is the victory that overcommeth the world, even our faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.4. where by the world is meant the whole Kingdome of Satan: and thus we overcome or bruise under our feete by faith in Christ our Head: not every one that professeth Christ shall share in this victory; but every one that beleeveth in Christ, and every one that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth such as are enemies unto Christ. It is <hi>Origens</hi> observation upon the Text, God is said, <hi>Suscitare Satanam negligentibus, conterere studiosis,</hi> to raise up Satan or an adversary to those which are negligent, as he is said to have stirred up Satan, an adversary to King <hi>Salomon,</hi>

Others think this was fulfilled in <hi>Constantine,</hi> who overthrew Idolatry; but I rather assent to the first taking in that of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> who holdeth, that even then presently this was in part fulfilled. God gave the <hi>Romanes</hi> constancy both against the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane persecutors, and spirituall wisdome against false teachers; that though they might seeme, yet indeed they could not, nor did not prevaile against them: the like strength of grace doth he give to all his Saints; he so confirmed them against Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, Hereticks, and all the limbs of Satan, that though for the present they may seeme to have the worst, yet erelong, they shall prevaile against them. The Church may be opposed, oppressed, her peace disturbed, her discipline violated, her doctrine vilified, her teachers scandalized, her
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:177024:20"/>members persecuted: But will God alwaies shew himselfe regardlesse of his Church? No, no, hee will for the present give them sufficient strength against their enemies, and ere long, bruise their enemies under their feet. The <hi>God of Peace will bruise Satan,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shortly.</hi>

We have no more cause to be dismaied, when we see such adversaries oppose the Church, then <hi>Noah</hi> had when the floud came, or <hi>Lot</hi> at the destruction of <hi>Sodome,</hi> or little <hi>David</hi> at the setting forth of great <hi>Goliah:</hi> for <hi>the God of Peace</hi> hath promised to make us Victors.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:177024:20"/>Then what if the Synagogue of Satan for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent hath the upper hand of the Church of Christ, yet let us learne to waite, which is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond use.</p>

He will drive out the wild Boare of the Forrest, though (for the present) he suffers him to make havock of his owne Vineyard. Wee heare to our griefe, how our neighbour Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches lie bleeding under the sword of a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse enemy, that Satans adherents or associates, his Agents or Factors doe tyranize over the poore Saints. What shall we hence inferre? that Satan rageth because he hath but a short time, the time is comming and it is now at hand, when <hi>the God of peace shall bruise Satan under their feet.</hi> Heaven and earth shall sooner passe away, then Satan carry the victory, or triumph in the totall ruine and finall downefall of the Church.

               </gap>cateth them to be tokens of great joy. Southsayers and Astronomers would have taken these for signes of destruction: but he that is the best Prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator shewes they are signes of Consolation, bids his people not to be troubled at them; but <hi>when they see these things come to passe, then to looke up, to lift up their heads; because their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption draweth neare.</hi> Sorrow commonly makes a man to looke downewards, to goe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily, to knit his browes together; but joy makes a man to hold up his head to stretch out his browes, to looke merrily and pleasantly about him. This Christ bids us to carry our selves when we see the signes forementioned: not to despaire, but hope not to looke downe, but considering that these things doe declare the full redemption of the Church, and destruction of all her enemies: they are as the <hi>Heraulds</hi> of him who is <hi>the God of Peace,</hi> whereby he giveth us to understand, that he himselfe is not farre behind; but is even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>bruise Satan under our feet shortly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, our Saviour illustrateth the same unto us by a similitude, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.32. drawne from the fig-tree, <hi>when his branch is yet tender, and puts forth leaves, yee know that Summer is nigh, so who yee shall see all these things, know that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is neare, even at the doores.</hi> Who would thinke that warres, persecutions, and the like should be as the shooting of buds, and the blossoming of trees? man would rather thinke
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:177024:21"/>that these should be likened to a rough and sharp winter, which with intolerable cold nippeth the tender buds, and kills the fruits of the earth: but he that is the best Expositor of his words, tells us the contrary; and bids us when wee see such things, to take notice that the pleasant Summer is now at hand, that the earth will shortly bring forth goodly Lillies and sweet Roses, that wee shall have tranquillity and peace. Let us print these things in our mindes, and now whilst we behold that which our Saviour foretold, let us make a right use of it, not hanging downe our heads through feare, but lifting up our heads and hearts with hope. The hearbes which in the winter time lie hid in the earth, and the trees the juice thereof being kept in with cold, cannot spring and bring forth buds, blossomes and leaves; but looke for the Spring, at which time shooting out their buds, they flourish, and are lively to behold. In like manner ought we to looke for the time when God shall fully accomplish this promise made in the Text, when the sharp winter shall be ended, the pleasant Summer come, such a Summer as shall never end.</p>
            <p>It is this looking or expectation of hope which must be our staffe to rest upon in this our Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, whilst we are over-laden with the burthen of sorrow inflicted upon us by Satan and such as disturbe our peace: but this staffe will doe us no good, except we take it in our hands, and use it at times convenient. Now is a time convenient, now is the Church oppressed and her members
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:177024:22"/>distressed, then, now let us stretch forth our hands, and take the staffe of hope and rest upon it in our greatest dangers. This is a second use, hope and waite for the accomplishment of this promise; waite for it, because it is not presently accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; hope for it, because it shall be speedily or shortly accomplished. Behold! our Saviour the Prince of Peace is comming, and comming quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.11. Our God of peace is comming, and that shortly, to settle his Church in peace, and to <hi>bruise Satan under our feete.</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse. </seg>3</label> so we must pray for this; we are taught thus much in our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Liturgie, to beseech God <hi>that it would please him to tread downe Satan under our feete.</hi> If we could see perfectly (saith <hi>Luther</hi>) how we are compassed every where with an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Divells, which every minute of an hower aime at us, and shoot at us with their venemous darts, then we would pray daily, kneeling upon our knees, yea, and would weepe bloud, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Lord to make an end of this wretched life, to accomplish his promises and our happinesse. The promise in the Text shall not fully be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, till there be an accomplishment of all things; for that therefore we ought to pray. And surely if wee have any pittie of the poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians that are so much afflicted; if any zeale for Gods glory, which is so much despised; if any love to the Gospell, which is so much blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; wee will pray for the accomplishment of this promise: that is, for the peace of <hi>Sion,</hi> for the

If hee took so much pittie upon one Christian in misery, how much pittie ought wee to take upon many thousand Christians in ten thousand miseries? The pittie which wee ought to have on others should moove us to pray for this; but if there be in our breasts no sparke of pittie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, yet let us pittie our selves, who (saith Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>) can have any delight to live in so troublesome an estate, being (as it were) beset with swords and daggers ready drawne against us, so that it seemeth impossible to escape, if wee had a thousand lives? Who in this case can be merry, before he see some man come to deliver him? Behold this is our case, if wee had eyes to see the danger that hangeth over our heads. It is our case at all times; but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at this perilous time, in which Satan and all his instruments have conspired against our Church: then let us at least pittie our selves; and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion upon our selves, let us speedily pray for deliverance: let us say as Christ hath taught us, <hi>Thy Kingdome come. Come Lord Iesus, come quickly. Shorten these daies of sinne. Hasten thine owne Kingdome. Weaken the kingdome of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, destroy Satan and all his Confederates:</hi> such prayers have a kinde of omnipotency, they will

Thus farre <hi>Luther.</hi> To come to our selves: have not wee of this land seene that it is but folly to plot against the Church?

So that all wretched endeavours against the house of God, are like <hi>Caligula's</hi> enterprizes, who never took any thing in hand, if there were hope to effect it. Mee thinks wicked men should take notice of this, and consider what a folly, yea, and what a misery it is to attempt any thing against the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, for in so doing, they fight against God; they dare the highest Majesty of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to whet his glittering sword, and take hold of judgement; to put on his Habergeon of Righteousnesse, and the garment of Vengeance for cloathing. This should strike feare into their horny, stony, flinty, steely hearts, and make them tremble, maugre their audacity. Whosoever thou art that art opposite to the Church, opposite to the Saints, thou art an instrument of Satan, then sure to fall with Satan. Thou maiest for the present oppresse the people of God, trip up their heeles with frauds, lay them along with injuries and then
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:177024:26"/>trample on them; ride over their heads (as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 66.12.) and bruise them under feet; but ere long the case will be altered, they shall bruise thee, together with thy grand Captaine Satan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their feet. <hi>The God of Peace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I conclude all with that notable Oration of <hi>Abijah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah</hi> (having in his Armie foure hundred thousand) made to <hi>Ieroboam</hi> King of <hi>Israel</hi> and his Army of eight hundred thousand, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.8. &amp; 12. <hi>Yee be a great multitude, and there be with you golden calves; but with us is God himselfe for our Captaine, and his Priests with sounding Trumpets to cry alarum against you: O children of Israel, fight yee not against the God of your fathers; for yee shall not prosper.</hi> The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church have with them golden calves, strange gods, Idols of their owne making which shall worke their ruine: but the people of God have with them God himselfe, he is with them, and for them, he is their Captaine, and will give them the victory. Therefore let all men take heed how they oppose them; in so doing they fight against God, and therefore shall not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper.</p>
            <p>Thus yee see how this Scripture serves for terrour to the wicked, for comfort to the rest: It hath taught us the safety of a Christian, the duty of a Christian, the dignity of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
            <p>First, the safety of a Christian, he is sure of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest over all his enemies: he shall stand safe, like unto <hi>Mount Sion which cannot be moved.</hi>

            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:177024:27"/>
            <p>Secondly, the duty of a Christian; sith he is sure of Victory, let him therefore go on couragiously, and hold out constantly.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the dignity of a Christian; he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced above Satan and all opposites; they are his inferiours, his vassails, they lie under his feet. The Pope thinkes it a great dignity for Princes to kneele before him, and kisse his feet: but greater is the dignity of Christians; at whose feet the Prince of the aire, and all his followers shall lie prostrate.</p>
